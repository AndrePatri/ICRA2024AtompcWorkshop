\section{A hybrid approach: \textnormal{\textit{Learning-Based Receding Horizon Control with Reinforcement Learning}}}
Most of the currently employed control tools rely either on online ``model-based'' controllers~\cite{modern_mpc:neunert2018whole,web::atlas_grip_boston_dyn} (e.g. Receding Horizon Control) or ``model-free'' learned policies (e.g. Reinforcement Learning)~\cite{mpc_learn:aswani2012provably, mpc_learn:terzi2018learning, mpc_learn:soloperto2018learning, rl:schneider2023learning, rl:miki2024learning,mpc_learn:berkenkamp2016safe,mpc_learn:marco2016automatic,mpc_learn:brunner2015stabilizing,mpc_learn:rosolia2019learning,mpc_learn:englert2017inverse,mpc_learn:koller2018learning,mpc_learn:wabersich2021probabilistic,mpc_learn:gillulay2011guaranteed,mpc_learn:wabersich2018safe,mpc_learn:berkenkamp2017safe}, which are usually trained offline. Both approaches are historically deeply rooted in DP and MDPs. 
In the past years there have been several attempts at combining-learning based method and receding horizon controllers~\cite{mpc_learn:tsounis2020deepgait,mpc_learn:gangapurwala2021real}. Specifically, the following main approaches can be identified~\cite{mpc_learn:hewing2020learning}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[1)] \textit{Model augmentation}: integration of learned models into RHC controllers to improve prediction accuracy and control performance~\cite{mpc_learn:aswani2012provably,mpc_learn:terzi2018learning,mpc_learn:soloperto2018learning}.
	\item[2)] \textit{Adaptive tuning} and \textit{parameter optimization}: RHC parameters tuning (e.g. weights, costs, constraints), based on real-time data~\cite{mpc_learn:berkenkamp2016safe,mpc_learn:marco2016automatic,mpc_learn:brunner2015stabilizing,mpc_learn:rosolia2019learning,mpc_learn:englert2017inverse}.
	\item[3)] \textit{Safety}: a learned-policy is coupled with a RHC controller, which in this context takes the role of a \textit{safety filter}~\cite{mpc_learn:koller2018learning,mpc_learn:wabersich2021probabilistic,mpc_learn:gillulay2011guaranteed,mpc_learn:wabersich2018safe,mpc_learn:berkenkamp2017safe}.
